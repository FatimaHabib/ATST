
Musical performance requires prediction to operate instruments, to
perform in groups and to improvise. In this paper, we investigate how a
number of digital musical instruments (DMIs), including two of our own,
have applied predictive machine learning models that assist users by
predicting unknown states of musical processes. We characterise these
predictions as focussed within a musical instrument, at the level of
individual performers, and between members of an ensemble. These models
can connect to existing frameworks for DMI design and have parallels in
the cognitive predictions of human musicians.

We discuss how recent advances in deep learning highlight the role of
prediction in DMIs, by allowing data-driven predictive models with a
long memory of past states. The systems we review are used to motivate
musical use-cases where prediction is a necessary component, and to
highlight a number of challenges for DMI designers seeking to apply deep
predictive models in interactive music systems of the future.
