
We consider the problem of distributed computation of the nearest lattice point for a two dimensional lattice.
An interactive two-party model of communication  is considered. Algorithms with bounded, as well as unbounded, number of rounds of communication are considered. For the algorithm with a bounded number of rounds, expressions are derived for the error probability as a function of the total number of communicated bits. We observe that the error exponent  depends on the lattice. With an infinite number of allowed communication rounds, the average cost of achieving zero error probability is shown to be .
