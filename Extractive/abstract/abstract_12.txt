
Significant research has been conducted in recent years to extend
Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) methods to induce Answer Set Programs (ASP). 
These methods perform an exhaustive search for the correct 
hypothesis by encoding an ILP problem instance as an ASP program. 
Exhaustive search, however, results in loss of scalability. In addition, the language bias employed
in these methods is overly  restrictive too. In this paper we extend our previous
work on learning stratified answer set programs that have a single stable model
to learning arbitrary (i.e., non-stratified) ones with multiple stable models.
Our extended algorithm is a greedy FOIL-like algorithm, capable of inducing 
non-monotonic logic programs, examples of which includes programs for 
combinatorial problems such as graph-coloring and N-queens. To the best of our 
knowledge, this is the first heuristic-based ILP algorithm to induce answer set programs
with multiple stable models.
