 In Fig. In Fig. . In Table , we briefly describe the contributions by Indian authors in APS journals. in high energy Physics. In Fig. (a), CC has been estimated for all papers in Phys. In Fig. In Fig. In Table ,we show a sample of the network growth (graph size from 1970 to 2010)  with time for all the journals, counting only Indians and Indian-Foreign authors together. panels (a-f). , we show the complete networks for PRA-PRL journals from (1970-2013), with all authors (I-IF) and with only Indian authors (I-I). In Table , we notice these topological differences through network measures average degree , clustering coefficient  and mean path length . As an illustration, in Fig. In Table. In Fig. (a), we show the variation of number of communities for different APS journals. Fig. In Fig. , we show the static structure of Indian physics coauthorship network. PRA and PRE have only tiny and small communities. Based on the author's affiliation, we label each author as I (Indian) and Foreigner (F). The life span of a community is the difference between the birth , and the death  , when . C.S. conducted all the coding, data analysis and visualization and writing. S.J.
