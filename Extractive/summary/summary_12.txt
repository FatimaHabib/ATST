 In , Sakama introduces algorithms to induce 
a { logic programanswer set program with at most one stable model.} In , Sakama extends his work to learn from   
multiple answer sets. ). Now, FOLD is recursively called to learn a 
rule for , . Next, we present our XFOLD algorithm. {ll}
                   & conflict(Y,X).} . To learn this constraint, negative examples are needed. Next, the partial  score is 
computed.
