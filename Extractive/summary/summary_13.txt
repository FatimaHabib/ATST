 This implies the same result under . For a set of vertices , we denote by  the subgraph induced by . Let  and  be -colorable sets in a graph . Then,  for a nonnegative integer 
if  and , where
 denotes the symmetric difference . Let  and  be -colorable sets in a graph . Let  and  be -colorable sets of size  in a graph . Then,  under  if and only if  under . There are many graph classes of perfect graphs. The  of two disjoint graphs  and 
is the graph . Namely,  if and only . If  or  is locked in , then . For ,  if and only if none of  and  is locked in . Assume  and  are locked in  but not in . Assume  and  are locked in  but not in . Let  and . Let  and  be independent sets of size  in . Let  and . Now  and  hold. Assume that  under . This implies that . Therefore,  also holds. Thus  under . For a shortest -- path  in , we set . Let  and  be shortest -- path in . Hence  and . Assume that  under . This implies that . Therefore,  and  differ exactly at one vertex. For ,  on interval graphs is left unsettled.
