 However, since uncompressed network logs will consume a lot of network bandwidth, it makes sense to have available a compressed representation of  a  network log. Th. II, Ch. II, . 10, Ch. The  entry of V is , thus . When , we will write  as shorthand for . Let  and let  denote the error probability. However, when the lattice is scaled by  (i.e. Let . Let . Let . For , ,  and . If , no partitioning step is taken. Let , . Let , . Let  and . When the algorithm halts, . Let  and  denote averages over . a - tree. two messages).
