 Denote the maximum amount broadcasted among the three servers by  files for all the requests. In particular when   is large,  if , and  if  or . }W_{d_k,}



Clearly the server broadcasts  times. A bipartite graph, denoted by , is a graph whose vertices are divided into
two disjoint parts  and  such that every edge in  connects a vertex in  to one in . If , then there is a saturating matching.

} Denote , , ,  and , , , . That is . A bipartite graph  where

=_{{2};_1 ,_1 },=_{{2};_1 ,b_1} _{{2};a_1,_1},

can be obtained. From Table , we have  and . Of course we can also assume that
