 Based on 3D time-lapse imaging, the entire cell lineage can be automatically traced, and quantitative measurements can be made on every cell to characterize its developmental behaviors . In collective cell migration, all the cell movements are directional. . . ). (). The closer two cells are, the larger penalty (negative reward) they receive. The closer the cell is to the eggshell, the larger penalty (negative reward) it receives. Based on our extensive experiments, we discovered that an enumeration of eight directions of action, with  between each of them, is good enough for this scenario. ). ()).
