 It is also assumed that there exists  tasks in the environment . It is assumed that each task is associated to one PoI (target) and the PoIs can be located in different positions with a diverse set of resource requirements. The tasks are carried out by the formed coalitions , where each coalition  is responsible for one task. Moreover,  is defined as the cost of coalition  in performing task . and  are the probability of  amplitudes where the qubit can be at states  and ,  respectively. It is also assumed that the UAVs are self-interested, meaning that if a UAV receives multiple requests, it will consider joining the coalition which offers the highest benefit. Algorithm  shows the pseudo-code for the multi-UAV coalition formation. It is assumed that the UAVs and PoIs are uniformly distributed across the region and the closest UAV to the PoI is considered to be the one that first detects the PoI and form a coalition (as a coalition leader). It is also assumed that each UAV has five different types of resources. It is assumed that UAVs,  and  are not trustworthy.
